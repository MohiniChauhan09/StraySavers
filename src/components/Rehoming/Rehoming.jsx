                <li><span>Personalized Matching:</span> We carefully assess each dog's personality, needs, and preferences to find the perfect match with prospective adopters.</li>
                <li><span>Supportive Process: </span> Our team provides guidance and support throughout the adoption journey, offering advice on integration, training, and ongoing care.</li>
                <li><span>Post-Adoption Follow-Up: </span> We stay connected with adopters to ensure a smooth transition and address any questions or concerns that may arise.</li>
